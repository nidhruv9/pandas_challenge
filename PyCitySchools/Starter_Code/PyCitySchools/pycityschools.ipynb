    "Summary Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pycityschools analysis, we have created different DataFrames (named: school_summary, school_spending_df, size_summary and type_summary) to analyse the overall performance of different schools in the district i.e. average scores along with percentage of passing in math or/and reading based on spending, size and type of the schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After analysing the spending_summary and size_summary DataFrames, we may say that overall performance is decreasing as per student budget or school sizes are increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. By looking at the type_summary DataFrame we may conclude that district schools have much less overall passing rate than Charter schools.It is also matching with the fact that by overall performance criteria, the top five schools are all charter whereas bottom five schools are all district schools."
